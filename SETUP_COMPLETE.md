# 🎮 Asteroid Storm Online - Setup Complete! 

## ✅ What's Been Built

You now have a complete **modern multiplayer Asteroids game** with:

### 📦 Project Structure
- **Monorepo** with 3 packages: `client`, `server`, `shared`
- **TypeScript** throughout with proper type sharing
- **pnpm workspaces** for efficient dependency management
- **Build scripts** and development tooling

### 🖥️ Client (Frontend)
- **Vite + Three.js** for fast development and 3D rendering
- **Vector graphics** rendering system for classic Asteroids look
- **Input management** with WASD/arrow keys + space
- **UI system** with join menu, HUD, player list
- **Audio system** with procedurally generated retro sounds
- **Client-side prediction** for smooth multiplayer

### 🖧 Server (Backend)
- **Node.js + WebSockets** for real-time multiplayer
- **Room-based** architecture (up to 8 players per room)
- **Server-authoritative** physics simulation
- **60 Hz tick rate** with configurable snapshot broadcasting
- **Spatial hashing** for efficient collision detection
- **Anti-cheat** measures with server validation

### 🔄 Shared Logic
- **Game physics** simulation (movement, collisions, particles)
- **Type definitions** shared between client and server
- **Math utilities** for vector operations
- **Constants** for game configuration
- **Entity management** (players, asteroids, bullets, particles)

### 🎯 Core Features Implemented
- ✅ Real-time multiplayer with WebSocket communication
- ✅ Server-authoritative game state with client prediction
- ✅ Classic Asteroids gameplay (shoot, break apart, score)
- ✅ Room system with join codes or quick-play
- ✅ Retro vector graphics with Three.js
- ✅ Spatial audio with Web Audio API
- ✅ Responsive controls and smooth 60fps gameplay
- ✅ Player lives, scoring, and respawn system
- ✅ World wrapping (toroidal map)
- ✅ Particle effects for thrust, explosions, hits

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open browser:**
   - Client: http://localhost:5173
   - Enter player name and join game!

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Move:** WASD or Arrow keys (W/↑ thrust, A/← rotate left, D/→ rotate right, S/↓ brake)
- **Shoot:** Spacebar
- **Join:** Enter name, optionally enter room code, click "Join Game"
- **Objective:** Shoot asteroids to break them apart and score points
- **Survive:** Avoid colliding with asteroids (you have 3 lives)

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit these files to customize the game:

- **Game rules:** `shared/src/constants.ts`
- **Visual style:** `shared/src/constants.ts` (RENDER_CONFIG)
- **Server settings:** `.env` file
- **Network settings:** `shared/src/constants.ts` (NETWORK_CONFIG)

## 🎨 Next Steps & Extensions

The foundation is complete! Consider adding:

- **Power-ups** (shields, rapid fire, hyperspace)
- **UFO enemies** with AI targeting
- **Particle effects** improvements
- **Sound effects** variations
- **Leaderboards** and persistent scores
- **Spectator mode**
- **Better mobile controls**
- **WebRTC** for even lower latency
- **Docker deployment**
- **Database** for user accounts
- **Tournaments** and matchmaking

## 🐛 Known Notes

- Some TypeScript build configurations may need fine-tuning for production
- The project uses modern ES modules - ensure Node.js 18+ is used
- WebSocket connections require HTTPS in production (use WSS)
- Mobile touch controls could be added for better mobile support

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You now have a fully functional multiplayer Asteroids game with modern web technologies. The architecture is clean, scalable, and ready for further development. Players can join rooms, compete in real-time, and experience smooth 60fps gameplay with proper netcode.

**Happy gaming and coding!** 🚀✨
